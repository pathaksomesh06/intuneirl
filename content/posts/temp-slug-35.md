<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>Zscaler Cloud Connector (ZCC) is a cloud-native zero trust access service that provides fast and secure app-to-app, app-to-Internet connectivity across multi- and hybrid cloud environments. An integrated, automated connectivity and security stack eliminates the complexity and cost of managing multiple network services in cloud environments. It serves as a faster, smarter and more secure alternative to legacy network-centric solutions such as Cloud VPN, virtual firewalls and cloud routers.<br>Secure Multi- and Hybrid Cloud Connectivity<br>ZCC eliminates the need for provisioning and managing cumbersome VPN/MPLS connections between clouds and on-premise environments. It establishes inside-out DTLS connections across multi- and hybrid clouds, brokered through Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange. The inside-out connectivity approach provides zero trust access between applications without the need for network access.</p>



<p>Using Zscaler Client Connector, you can get all of the benefits of the Zscaler service for Internet traffic and granular, policy-based access to internal resources from a single point.</p>



<ul><li>With Zscaler Client Connector&#8217;s Internet Security feature, you can protect your users&#8217; web traffic even when they are outside your corporate network. </li></ul>



<ul><li>With Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), you can securely enable your users to access enterprise applications outside the corporate network. ZPA establishes a secure transport for accessing your enterprise apps and services.</li></ul>



<p>You can also configure app profiles and specify, for example, how the app detects when a user is connected to a trusted network and, if a trusted network is detected, whether the app must disable its service. For greater flexibility, you can configure app profiles to apply to all users or specific groups of users in your organization.</p>
