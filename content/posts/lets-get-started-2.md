<p>So, you have decided to use Intune for the modern management of your devices; now, let’s get you started with the basics of setting up the tenant and some required configurations. </p>



<p><strong>Microsoft Intune</strong> (formerly Windows Intune) is a part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager, a Microsoft cloud-based management tool that provides unified endpoint management of both corporate and personal devices. This helps organizations to protect corporate data. </p>



<p>It also extends some of the “on-premises” functionality of Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager to the Windows Azure cloud. </p>



<p>To start with, your first question would be about licensing – “<strong>What license do I need for managing my devices?</strong>” </p>



<p>Intune license is included under the following products:</p>



<ul><li>Microsoft 365 E5</li><li>Microsoft 365 E3</li><li>Enterprise Mobility + Security E5</li><li>Enterprise Mobility + Security E3 </li><li>Microsoft 365 Business Premium</li><li>Microsoft 365 F1</li><li>Microsoft 365 F3</li><li>Microsoft 365 Government G5</li><li>Microsoft 365 Government G3</li><li>Intune for Education</li></ul>



<p>Microsoft Intune also offers a <strong>device-only subscription</strong> service that will help you manage devices that aren’t affiliated with specific users, e.g., shared workstations.</p>



<p>You can’t assign an Intune device license. Instead, the usage will be based on trust, i.e., device usage.  </p>



<p>Now that you know which license you will need to manage your devices, let’s start and fire up the tenant!  </p>
