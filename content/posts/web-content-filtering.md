<p><strong>ContentFiltering (CF)</strong> allows you to restrict access to specific websites for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users who are enrolled in a mobile device management (MDM) solution. You can use the WebContentFilter payload to specify which websites the device can access. You can automatically filter the content and then allow or deny access to specific websites. You can also use this to configure a device to view only specific websites and create bookmarks for those websites.</p><hr>
