<p><strong>What is the D-U-N-S number?</strong></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Data Universal Numbering System</strong>, commonly abbreviated as&nbsp;<strong>DUNS</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>D-U-N-S</strong>, is a proprietary system developed and managed by&nbsp;<strong>Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B)</strong>&nbsp;that assigns a unique numeric identifier to as a &#8220;DUNS number&#8221; to a single business entity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was introduced in the 1960s for credit reporting and is now standard followed worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a nine-digit number assigned to each business entity with a unique, separate, and distinct operation to identify them. The DUNS number is random, and the digits have no apparent significance. </p>

<h4><strong>Why D-U-N-S is required for using Apple Services?</strong></h4>



<p>When an organization decides to buy Apple devices, then they have to buy Apple Enterprise services to buy &amp; manage these devices. ABM, Apple Developer Portal, etc., requires the organization to have a DUNS number. If an organization wants to distribute apps to different geographical locations, then it needs to have ABM subscriptions, and then for enrolling in ABM, you will need a DUNS number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>D-U-N-S Number will be used to check your organization&#8217;s identity and legal entity status as part of our enrollment verification process for joining the Apple Developer Program or the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. The company/business must be recognized as a legal entity (such as a corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company) to enter into the legal terms and obligations of the Apple Developer Program agreements. It does not allow DBAs, fictitious businesses, trade names, and branches to register for it.</p>



<p>Companies and educational institutions must provide a D-U-N-S Number registered to their legal entity.</p>
