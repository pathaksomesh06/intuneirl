Microsoft Intune, on the other hand, is a powerful mobile device management (MDM) platform that integrates seamlessly with Android Enterprise, providing a wide range of features and capabilities for managing Android devices.</p><p>By combining Android Enterprise with Microsoft Intune, organizations can take advantage of a robust set of tools to enroll, configure, secure, and manage Android devices. Intune offers a unified management experience, allowing IT administrators to control device settings, deploy applications, enforce security policies, and manage updates, all from a centralized console.</p><p>Intune can be used to manage Android Enterprise devices using a variety of enrollment options, including:</p><ul><li>Work profile for employee-owned devices (BYOD)</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="588" height="334"><figcaption>BYOD</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Work profile for mixed-used company-owned devices</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-5.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="795" height="363" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-5.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-5.png 795w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>COPE</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Full management for work-only company-owned devices</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-7.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="556" height="351"><figcaption>COBO</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Full management for dedicated devices</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="939" height="321" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-8.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-8.png 939w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>KIOSKs</figcaption></figure><p>An Android Enterprise solution is a combination of three components: EMM solution (MS Intune in our case), Android Device Policy, and managed Google Play.</p><p><strong>Android Device Policy</strong></p><p>Every Android device that an organization manages through its MDM solution must have Android Device Policy installed during the setup process. Android Device Policy, provided by Android itself, is an application that autonomously enforces the management policies established in the MDM console on the respective devices.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1074" height="629" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-9.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-9.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-9.png 1074w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Managed Google Play.</figcaption></figure><p>Managed Google Play represents the enterprise edition of Google Play, tailor-made to enhance app management within Android Enterprise solutions. It merges the well-known user interface and app store functions of Google Play with a collection of management features specifically engineered for corporate use. Managed Google Play can be embedded into your <strong>MDM <strong>console</strong></strong> to provide features such as:</p><ul><li>Public app search</li><li>Private app publishing</li><li>Web app publishing</li><li>App organization</li></ul><p>On devices that are managed, Managed Google Play serves as the enterprise app store for users. Its interface bears resemblance to the regular Google Play, allowing users to browse through apps, examine their details, and proceed with the installation. However, in contrast to the public version of Google Play, Managed Google Play restricts users to installing only those apps that have been specifically approved by their organization. This ensures alignment with corporate policies and helps maintain a secure environment.</p><p>Let's dive deeper to understand how Android devices are enrolled &amp; provisioned into MDM.</p><hr><h2 id="how-an-android-device-is-enrolled-provisioned"><a href="#How-an-Android-device-is-enrolled-provisioned">How an Android Device is Enrolled &amp; Provisioned</a></h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-10.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1249" height="396" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-10.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-10.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-10.png 1249w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Android Device Policy communication between MDM and managed devices</figcaption></figure><p>Device provisioning refers to the procedure of configuring a device so that it falls under the control of an enterprise through configured policies. This process involves the installation of Android Device Policy on the device, which then serves as the medium for receiving and enforcing these policies. If the provisioning proves successful, the API forms a device object, thereby linking the device to the enterprise.</p><p>The Android Management API initiates this provisioning process by utilizing enrollment tokens. Â When an enrollment token is provided to a device, it triggers the provisioning process. This procedure not only includes the installation of the Android Device Policy but also the addition of a managed Google Play account to the device. Once the device has been successfully provisioned, it is identified within the system as a Devices resource. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-11.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1789" height="795" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/image-11.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/image-11.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/08/image-11.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/08/image-11.png 1789w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Device provisioning with enrollment token</figcaption></figure><p>The enrollment token and provisioning method you use establishes a device's ownership (personally-owned or company-owned) and management mode (work profile or fully managed device).</p><blockquote>Enrollment tokens expire after one hour by default, but you can specify a custom expiration time (<code>duration</code>)<strong> up to approximately 10,000 years!</strong></blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://media.tenor.com/4CX-pXSoV18AAAAC/oh-really.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="498" height="370"><figcaption>10,000 Years!</figcaption></figure><p>An example of an enrollment token:</p><pre><code class="language-json">{

For instance, you can have your own T&amp;Cs app that users must accept the Terms and Conditions as part of the setup procedure. To indicate that the process has been completed and to allow Android Device Policy to finish the provisioning of the device or work profile, the app must return a RESULT_OK signal.</p><p>To successfully launch an app during the setup, the following steps must be adhered to:</p><blockquote>The app's 'installType' is set to 'REQUIRED_FOR_SETUP.'
