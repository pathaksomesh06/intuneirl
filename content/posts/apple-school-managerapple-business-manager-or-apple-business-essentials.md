In previous parts, we discussed how the devices are enrolled in any MDM solution and how MDM communicates with devices. We also discussed different types of enrollment, and you can take advantage of them.

They allow you to manage your company's and school's iPad, iPhone as well as macOS devices.

Managed Apple IDs can be used to sync with school data, such as Classroom information and the schoolâ€™s student information system.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/image-20.png" class="kg-image" alt="https://school.apple.com/" loading="lazy" width="699" height="673" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-20.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/image-20.png 699w"><figcaption><a href="https://school.apple.com/">Apple School Manager</a></figcaption></figure><p>Educators can use Apple School Manager to access Apple's Classroom app, which provides a variety of resources for teaching students.
