<p>Welcome to <strong><em><em>part </em>four </em></strong>of the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/ios-device-management-with-microsoft-intune/">All-In-One guide to managing Apple devices with Microsoft Intune</a>. Till now, we have discussed how the devices are enrolled in any MDM solution, different types of enrollment, and how to decide between Apple Business Manager or Apple Business Essentials, or Apple School Manager. Here's the link to the first three parts:</p><ol><li><a href="__GHOST_URL__/ios-device-management-with-microsoft-intune/#managing-devices-and-corporate-data">The need to manage devices and data</a></li><li><a href="__GHOST_URL__/getting-started-ade-mdm/">Getting Started - Apple Device Enrollment types &amp; MDM</a></li><li><a href="__GHOST_URL__/apple-school-managerapple-business-manager-or-apple-business-essentials/">Device Deployment: ABM or ASM, or ABE? (intuneirl.com)</a></li></ol><hr><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>Apple Business Manager is a web-based portal that helps IT administrators manage iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices. This portal works with a third-party MDM solution, allowing you to purchase content easily in volume.</p><hr><h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2><p>To automatically add devices to Apple Business Manager, the following conditions must be met:</p><ol><li>If the device was purchased directly from Apple, the purchaser must have used an enrolled and verified Apple Customer Number.</li><li>If the device was purchased directly from a participating Apple Authorized Reseller or a cellular carrier, the device must be linked to that reseller's Reseller Number. </li><li>The device must have been ordered after March 1, 2011, whether purchased directly from Apple or a participating Apple Authorized Reseller or cellular carrier.</li></ol><hr><p>Enrollment in ABM is simple and takes only a few minutes. Any business can sign-up for ABM subject to the service terms and conditions. The first thing to get started is registering in D-U-N-S.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-d-u-n-s-number">What is the "D-U-N-S" number?</h2><p>The <strong>Data Universal Numbering System</strong>, commonly abbreviated as <strong>DUNS</strong> or <strong>D-U-N-S</strong>, is a proprietary system developed and managed by <strong>Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B)</strong> that assigns a unique numeric identifier to a “<em>DUNS number</em>” to a single business entity.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/image-56.png" class="kg-image" alt="D-U-N-S" loading="lazy" width="488" height="334"><figcaption>D-U-N-S</figcaption></figure><p>It was introduced in the 1960s for credit reporting and is now standard followed worldwide.</p><p>A nine-digit number is assigned to each business entity with a unique, separate, and distinct operation to identify them. The DUNS number is random, and the digits have no apparent significance.</p><h3 id="why-d-u-n-s-number-is-required-for-apple-services">Why "D-U-N-S" number is required for Apple Services?</h3><p>When an organization decides to buy Apple devices, they must buy Apple Enterprise services to buy &amp; manage these devices. ABM, Apple Developer Portal, etc., requires the organization to have a DUNS number. If an organization wants to distribute apps to different geographical locations, it needs to have ABM subscriptions, and then for enrolling in ABM, you will need a DUNS number.</p><p>D-U-N-S Number will be used to check your organization’s identity and legal entity status as part of our enrollment verification process for joining the Apple Developer Program or the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. The company/business must be recognized as a legal entity (such as a corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company) to enter into the legal terms and obligations of the Apple Developer Program agreements. It does not allow DBAs, fictitious businesses, trade names, and branches to register for it. Companies and educational institutions must provide a D-U-N-S Number registered to their legal entity.</p><h3 id="steps-for-requesting-a-d-u-n-s-number">Steps for requesting a "D-U-N-S" number </h3><p>It could be possible that D&amp;B may have already assigned your organization a free D-U-N-S Number. Before enrolling, <a href="https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/lookup.html?ref=intuneirl.com" rel="noreferrer noopener">look up your organization</a> to see if you have a D-U-N-S Number. If your company is not listed, you can submit your information to Dun &amp; Bradstreet for a free D-U-N-S Number.</p><p>You’ll be asked for the following information when looking up your organization:</p><ul><li>Legal entity name</li><li>Headquarters address</li><li>Mailing address</li><li>Your work contact information</li></ul><p>A D&amp;B representative will contact you directly for more information (such as your business type or the number of employees) as part of their verification process.</p><ol><li>Click or copy the following link to your browser  <a href="https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/get-a-duns.html">Get a D-U-N-S Number – Establish Your Business – D&amp;B (dnb.com)</a></li><li>Select your Primary Reason for D-U-N-S Number Registration from the drop-down menu.</li><li>Complete the company information sections. You must provide information about your organization, like legal name, address, contact name &amp; title.</li><li>Review Details</li><li>Click the “Submit” button to complete your request.</li><li>Once you have completed the entire process, you will receive a confirmation email.  It will take 24 to 48 hours to receive your D‐U‐N‐S Number, which you will receive via email for your records.</li></ol><hr><p>The next step is to get onboarded with Apple Business Manager. So, we continue with logging into ABM. The enrollment process is as below:</p><h2 id="sign-up-for-abm">Sign-up for ABM </h2><ol><li>Sign in to <strong><a href="https://business.apple.com">Apple Business Manager</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://school.apple.com">Apple School Manager</a></strong>.</li><li>Click "<strong>Enroll Now</strong>."</li><li>Enter the information for your organization, like Organization Name, D-U-N-S number, Phone Number, etc.</li></ol><p>The user signing up for the ABM for the first time by default becomes the first administrator on ABM as they enrol in ABM on behalf of the organization. This administrator should agree to the program and software license agreements of ABM. The initial account administrator can create/give four other users as "administrators" in the ABM. Also, these accounts can't be associated with any existing Apple ID or other Apple services.</p><p>Apple will review all the information provided and will contact this representative, and they may be asked for additional information by phone or email before the enrollment is approved.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/image-52.png" class="kg-image" alt="Your the location where your organization is registered" loading="lazy" width="822" height="606" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-52.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/image-52.png 822w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Choose the location where your organization is registered.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/image-54.png" class="kg-image" alt="Enrollment Review" loading="lazy" width="749" height="490" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-54.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/image-54.png 749w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Enrollment Review</figcaption></figure><p>Once your call has been received and Apple confirms your eligibility for Apple Business Manager (ABM), you'll get an email asking you to agree to the Terms and Conditions. Be aware that the link in the email is time-sensitive and will expire after a week. If you don't complete this step within the 7-day timeframe, you'll have to reach out to Apple once more to proceed.</p><p>When verified the administrator will be emailed instructions for setting up ABM for the business. A verification code will be sent to your email id and phone number entered when creating the managed ID. Enter the code sent to verify.</p><p>You will be then asked to create a managed Apple ID.

Some roles even have the authority to oversee other roles. For instance, a user designated as an Administrator has the ability to manage those in Manager or Staff roles.</p><p>It's worth noting that users holding the Administrator or People Manager roles cannot log in via federated authentication; they are only permitted to oversee the federated authentication process.</p><p>Furthermore, each role is defined by a collection of privileges that apply to all users holding that specific role. Staff roles come with minimal privileges, Manager roles offer more, and those in the Administrator role enjoy the most extensive range of privileges.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1150" height="686" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/image.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/image.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/image.png 1150w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Every user in ABM must have at least one role, and each role has certain privileges.
