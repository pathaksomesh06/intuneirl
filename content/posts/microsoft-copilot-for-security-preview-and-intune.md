<p><strong>Mobile device management just got smarter.</strong>  In today's fast-changing digital world, keeping devices secure and under control is crucial. Microsoft Intune has always been a leader in mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM), giving companies strong tools to handle work devices and apps. But with the addition of Microsoft Security Copilot, things are changing for the better. This integration combines Intune's proven strengths with Security Copilot's cutting-edge AI, completely revamping how we think about device management.</p><p>Imagine a future where AI not only makes things more secure but also simplifies management tasks, creating a smooth and secure experience for everyone using work devices. That's the promise of this integration. By taking this step, Microsoft is raising the bar for device management. They're giving IT professionals smarter, more efficient tools to handle the complex challenges of today's mobile world.</p><h3 id="revolutionizing-security-and-management-with-ai-integration"><strong>Revolutionizing Security and Management with AI Integration</strong></h3><p><strong>Intune just got a major AI upgrade.</strong>  Building on its strong foundation, Intune now works with Microsoft Security Copilot to create a whole new way of managing devices. This uses the power of generative AI, a fancy way of saying "smart AI that can make things."  This combo adds advanced security smarts to Intune. It can find threats in real-time and even suggest policies to fix them automatically. For IT folks, this means way less busywork keeping devices safe.</p><p>Copilot for Security's AI is like a super-security analyst, spotting risks and compliance issues before they become big problems. This lets you be proactive instead of just reacting to threats. Plus, Copilot can understand plain English!  Admins can ask questions about complex data and get answers in regular words, not computer code. This makes security info easier to understand for everyone, no matter their tech skills. It also helps make better decisions because the information is clear and actionable.</p><p>The bottom line?  This isn't just about better security.  By working together, Microsoft Security Copilot and Intune are changing the game for managing mobile devices.  Imagine a future where technology uses cutting-edge intelligence to automatically adapt to the needs of your digital workplace, making everything more secure and efficient.  That's the future this powerful duo is building.</p><p>Let's get started then!</p><hr><h3 id="copilot-for-security"><strong>Copilot for Security</strong></h3><p><strong>The wait is over!</strong>  Microsoft launched Copilot for Security on April 1, 2024, marking a significant step forward in AI-powered device management. Announced roughly a year ago, this innovative solution is now available to security leaders and their teams, empowering them to leverage the power of generative AI for enhanced mobile security.  In this blog, we'll delve into how Copilot for Security integrates with Intune, ushering in a new era of device management.</p><p><strong>Pay as you go:</strong>  Microsoft Copilot for Security uses a consumption-based pricing model, where you pay $4 per hour of usage for security compute units. This means you only pay for what you use, offering flexibility for organizations of all sizes.  While there are currently no discounts for pre-purchase or high volume usage, Microsoft might have chosen this approach for a few reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Faster Launch:</strong>&nbsp;A simpler pricing model likely streamlined the launch for Microsoft and potentially simplifies adoption for customers, avoiding confusion with existing licensing structures.</li><li><strong>Generative AI Pricing Evolution:</strong>&nbsp;The cost of generative AI solutions is still evolving across the industry. This model allows Microsoft to adapt pricing as the technology matures and user needs become clearer.</li></ul><h5 id="licensing-requirements"><br>Licensing requirements:</h5><p>Before you can access Security Copilot, it's best that your environment has the following licenses deployed:</p><ul><li>Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 (formerly known as Azure Active Directory Premium P1 or P2) license for role assignments to users.</li><li>Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 licenses.</li><li>Microsoft Security Copilot Access.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="onboarding-to-microsoft-security-copilot"><strong>Onboarding to Microsoft Security Copilot</strong></h3><h5 id="step-1-assign-roles">Step 1: Assign roles</h5><p>To access the Security Copilot portal, configure settings, or perform tasks, appropriate permissions must be assigned. In this section, you're guided on assigning roles for users in your organization to grant them access to Security Copilot. These steps are done in the&nbsp;Microsoft Entra admin center.</p><h5 id="required-role"><strong>Required role</strong></h5><p>One of the following roles is required to perform this task in the Microsoft Entra admin center:</p><ul><li>Groups Administrator</li><li>User Administrator</li><li>Privileged Role Administrator</li><li>Global Administrator</li></ul><h5 id="assign-roles-to-users">Assign roles to users</h5><p>Users must be assigned a global administrator, global reader, security administrator, security operator, or a security reader role to access
