It's time to unleash peak Mac performance and keep your users productive, all while ensuring top-notch device security thanks to those crucial updates.</p><hr><h3 id="behind-the-scenes"><strong>Behind the Scenes</strong></h3><p>Now that you've met the script, let's peek under the hood and see how it orchestrates these automated Mac reboots!</p><p>The script operates on a tiered system, taking a user-friendly approach to prompting reboots. Here's how it tailors notifications based on uptime:</p><ul><li><strong>1-5 Days: All Quiet on the Reboot Front:</strong>&nbsp;For systems that have been up for a short time (1-5 days), the script stays silent. This timeframe is considered normal operational uptime, so no need to nudge the user just yet.</li><li><strong>7-10 Days: Gentle Reminders Take Center Stage:</strong>&nbsp;As uptime climbs between 7-10 days, daily notifications gently appear. These are friendly reminders for the user to consider a reboot for optimal performance. Think of it as a subtle tap on the shoulder, suggesting it might be time for a refresh.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-29.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1384" height="316" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/image-29.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/image-29.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-29.png 1384w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li><strong>11-13 Days: Finding the Reboot Sweet Spot:</strong>&nbsp;For extended uptime scenarios (11-13 days), the script adopts a  <strong>balanced approach</strong> to notifications. This provides users with the flexibility to choose a reboot window that aligns best with their workflow, minimizing disruption.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-30.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1124" height="640" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/image-30.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/image-30.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-30.png 1124w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li><strong>15 Days and Beyond: Time for Action!</strong>&nbsp;When a Mac surpasses the 15-day uptime mark, the script kicks things up a notch. It triggers a more urgent dialog box with a countdown timer. This is the script's way of strongly suggesting an immediate reboot. After all, prolonged uptime can lead to sluggish performance and missed updates, which can compromise security. This countdown is a clear call to action, ensuring important updates are applied and the system remains healthy.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-33.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1424" height="680" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/image-33.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/image-33.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-33.png 1424w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-32.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1370" height="502" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/image-32.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/image-32.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-32.png 1370w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><hr><h3 id="deployment-and-customization"><strong>Deployment and Customization</strong></h3><p>Deploying this script through your MDM platform is a breeze.  You can push it as a custom script, meaning it runs at specific intervals you define.  Alternatively, you can configure it to trigger based on specific events, like system startup (<em><u>by hardcoding in the script</u></em>).  This ensures the script is always on the lookout for optimal reboot times.</p><h5 id="pre-requisites-ensuring-smooth-deployment"><strong>Pre-requisites: Ensuring Smooth Deployment</strong></h5><p>Before diving into the world of automated reboots and streamlined device management, there's a crucial step every MDM admin must undertake: deploying <code>swiftDialog</code>. This tool is the linchpin of our script, enabling it to communicate with users through polished, native macOS notifications and dialog boxes.</p><h6 id="why-swiftdialog"><strong>Why <code>swiftDialog</code>?</strong></h6><p><code>swiftDialog</code> serves as a bridge between our script's logic and the user's experience, offering a customizable and interactive interface that far surpasses standard notification capabilities. Its versatility allows us to craft messages that can't be ignored, ensuring our reboot prompts are both seen and acted upon.</p><h6 id="deploying-swiftdialog-with-mdm"><strong>Deploying <code>swiftDialog</code> with MDM:</strong></h6><p>To integrate <code>swiftDialog</code> into your macOS fleet, you'll deploy it using your MDM solution. While the exact steps will depend on your specific MDM platform, the essence is the same: package <code>swiftDialog</code> as an enterprise app and push it to your devices as a mandatory install with the required configuration. Here is the example, how I am deploying it:</p><ul><li>Adding swiftDialog as a pkg app:</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-25.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1032" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/image-25.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/image-25.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/image-25.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-25.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-26.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="592" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/image-26.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/image-26.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/image-26.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-26.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li>Next part is the most critical part for approving and setting Notification type via MDM. As we are using swiftDialog in the script to send system notifications, so it is important that we allow these settings via Intune. And, to achieve this, I am deploy the below mobileconfig that will pre-approve notifications and set the notification type. </li></ul><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div><div class="kg-callout-text">This pre-deployment step is crucial.
