These plugins enable connected services to be accessed, actions to be executed, and responses to be delivered to users of your copilot, all without the necessity for manually crafting intricate conversational flows.</p><p>Functioning as modular, interoperable components, plugins extend their utility across the Power Platform, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 environments. A unified plugin registry housed in Dataverse facilitates the sharing of all plugins across your Microsoft 365 tenant. Any creation or modification of a plugin, once published, is automatically disseminated to all copilots leveraging that plugin.</p><p>The process of creating a plugin involves defining its function in straightforward language, followed by specifying a data source or another type of connection. This information empowers the copilot to assess a conversation and select the most suitable plugin. Additionally, the copilot can autonomously request further details from the user as necessary to ensure the plugin operates effectively.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-19.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="663" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/image-19.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/image-19.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/image-19.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-19.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><hr><h3 id="sparkythe-it-self-service-copilot"><strong>Sparky - The IT Self Service CoPilot!</strong></h3><p>To illustrate the copilot's utility in assisting users with self-service tasks for devices enrolled in Microsoft Intune, consider this scenario: I have set up few sample topics designed to cover a range of common inquiries and operational tasks that users might encounter. These topics include checking compliance, installing applications, and troubleshooting common device issues. </p><p>The copilot -Sparky, equipped with these initial topics, serves as a starting point for automating user support.

This adaptability not only enhances the support experience for users managing their enrolled devices but also significantly reduces the workload on IT support staff by automating repetitive inquiries and tasks. Through this approach, the bot becomes an evolving tool that continuously improves in assisting users efficiently, fostering a more productive and satisfied user base.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-12-at-23.20.19.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1277" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-12-at-23.20.19.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-12-at-23.20.19.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-12-at-23.20.19.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-12-at-23.20.19.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The copilot, with its advanced automation features, automatically captures the user's email address, setting the stage for a proactive and personalized interaction. It greets the user and seamlessly transitions into assisting with specific needs. By leveraging a dedicated plugin, the copilot efficiently gathers data on the user’s enrolled devices, ensuring that the user is kept informed about their devices' status, updates, or any relevant actions that need to be taken.</p><p>Furthermore, the copilot utilizes conversation boosters, to enhance the communication flow. These boosters enable the copilot to present the information about the user's devices in a clear, concise, and user-friendly manner, facilitating a smoother user experience.</p><p>The progression of the copilot's capabilities doesn't stop there. It transforms into a virtual IT service desk, significantly empowering users. This transformation allows users not only to receive information but also to perform a variety of self-service tasks directly through the conversation interface. Users can troubleshoot common issues, request services, manage device settings, and more, all within the same interactive session.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-20.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1062" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/image-20.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/image-20.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/image-20.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-20.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The user selects the device id for which he/she needs support and Sparky comes-up with more support options.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-21.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1062" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/image-21.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/image-21.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/image-21.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/image-21.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><hr><h3 id="demo"><strong>Demo</strong></h3><p>Let's quickly explore a demonstration of the copilot to witness its comprehensive capabilities when used with Intune as MDM solution.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54sRg_fmd8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="How to build a Copilot in Copilot Studio with Generative Answers"></iframe></figure><hr><h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>In conclusion, Copilot (formerly Power Virtual Agents) ushers in a new era of conversational AI accessibility.
